## Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

# Overview

The files of interest are for part 2 are:
1) monkey_custom_cnn.py for classification using custom CNN architecture
2) monkey_transfer_feature_extraction.py for clssification without fine tuning
3) monkey_transfer_fine_tune.py for classification with fine tune. 



# Dependencies
- PyTorch
- numpy
- torchvision
- skimage
- matplotlib

# Runnig the code:
The datasets and helper function are in the correct folders. So just run the files mentioned in the overview section as is.
      
Note: Make sure all the dependencies are met.
